                Nature is the world around us, filled with diverse plants, animals, and landscapes. It provides essential resources like clean air, water, and food that support all living things. The beauty of nature can be seen in forests, mountains, oceans, and even small gardens. Spending time in nature helps people relax and appreciate the environment. Protecting nature is important for maintaining balance and ensuring a healthy planet for future generations.

                Nature is important because it provides the resources we need to survive, such as clean air, water, and food. It supports biodiversity, which helps maintain healthy ecosystems and balances the environment. Natural spaces offer places for recreation and relaxation, improving our mental and physical well-being. Nature also helps regulate the climate and protects us from natural disasters. Preserving nature is essential for the health of our planet and future generations.
