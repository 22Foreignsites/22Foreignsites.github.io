            <h2>Yeah man yeah man</h2>
            <p>The honey badger (Mellivora capensis), also known as the ratel, is a
            mustelid native to Africa, Southwest Asia, and the Indian subcontinent.
            It is famous for its thick skin and ferocious defensive abilities. The
            honey badger is primarily a carnivore and has few natural predators.</p>

            <p>
            Despite its name, the honey badger does not primarily eat honey. It is an
            opportunistic feeder and has a varied diet that includes small mammals,
            birds, reptiles, insects, and fruits. It is known for its ability to raid
            beehives to consume honey and bee larvae, often enduring multiple stings
            in the process.
